🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects and classifies various hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
The system recognizes gestures like Hello, Cool, Peace, Thumbs Up, One, Two, and more using a webcam.

The project uses MediaPipe’s Hand Landmark Model to track finger and palm positions and classifies gestures based on landmark relations.
It’s a great example of how computer vision can be used for gesture-based human-computer interaction — without any special sensors!

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time hand gesture detection
✅ Recognizes multiple gestures (Hello, Peace, Cool, etc.)
✅ Uses MediaPipe’s accurate Hand Landmark model
✅ Works with any standard webcam
✅ Lightweight and easy to run
